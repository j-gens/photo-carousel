## Testing

Tests have been split into two categories: front-end and back-end.  Both categories of tests use Jest as the test runner, mocking, and assertion library.

Front-end tests have also been written with Enzyme for additional testing utility.  The first time you run the front-end tests, Jest will create snapshots and corresponding folder within **/spec/client/** for you.  Run the front-end tests with the following command:
```
$ npm run-script test:client
```
Back-end tests have also been written with SuperTest for endpoint testing.  Run the back-end tests with the following command:
```
$ npm run-script test:server
```
